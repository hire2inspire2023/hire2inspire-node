                  hire2Inspire" operates through www.hire2inspire.com (referred to as the
                  "Site") and provides a Service accessible through this Site (referred to as
                  the "Service"). The platform caters to distinct groups of individuals
                  collectively termed as "Users," some of whom are under the responsibility of
                  "Entities" as defined in this agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Administrative Users" wield authority that impacts the entire Entity,
                  inclusive of entering or terminating these "Terms." An "Employer"
                  constitutes an Entity setting up sub-accounts on the Service for Users like
                  employees or other authorized personnel ("Authorized Users") who utilize the
                  Service on behalf of the Employer. These Authorized Users create job
                  postings referred to as "Jobs" on hire2Inspire to scout potential candidates
                  for specific positions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Candidates are individuals recommended by Users termed "Recruiters," who
                  present Candidates to Employers on behalf of an Entity referred to as an
                  "Agency." Collectively, all Users and Entities involved are termed "the
                  Parties." All Entities are obliged to consent to these Terms, achievable
                  through an Administrative User accepting them online, in writing, or via
                  hire2Inspire’s Site and/or any services related to these Terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Employers recognize that Authorized Users added by the Employer must accept
                  these Terms before establishing an account and will be bound by them.
                  Employers only extend invitations to Individuals capable of operating on the
                  Platform on behalf of the Employer under these Terms. Users possess varying
                  levels of control over the Entity as stipulated in the Platform. Specific
                  standard Authorized Users appointed by the Employer will possess the
                  authority to act on behalf of the Employer, including actions associated
                  with fees, such as hiring a Candidate for employment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Users cannot utilize the Service or agree to these Terms if (a) they do not
                  meet the legal age to form a binding contract with hire2Inspire; or (b) they
                  are prohibited by law, contract, or agreement with another company from
                  receiving or using the Service. All Users confirm their permission by an
                  Entity to use this Service when representing that Entity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additional terms ("Additional Terms") may apply depending on the User type.
                  These Additional Terms are referenced where applicable. In case of conflict
                  between these Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms prevail
                  concerning the Service.

                  hire2Inspire reserves the right to make changes to its Service at its
                  discretion. Significant changes to these Terms will be communicated to Users
                  via email or notice on the Site. Substantial changes become effective
                  immediately for subsequent Jobs and Submissions (defined in the Additional
                  Terms) but do not affect Jobs created before the notice. hire2Inspire may
                  require User consent to updated Terms for continued Service use. Otherwise,
                  Users' ongoing use of the Site or Service implies acceptance of the changes
                  and the complete Terms. Users are advised to routinely check the Site for
                  the latest Terms. Disagreement with revisions means the sole option is to
                  stop using the Service.

                  platform facilitating connections and communication between Employers and
                  Recruiters regarding job opportunities and candidates. However, hire2Inspire

                  complete control over and makes independent decisions regarding hiring or
                  not hiring candidates presented through the platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>3. FEES.&nbsp;</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Certain functionalities within hire2Inspire’s Service may necessitate the
                  payment of fees. These fees will be clearly outlined and detailed in the

                  hire2Inspire and/or its designated third-party payment provider with
                  accurate and complete billing and contact information as required. This
                  information might vary depending on User type but could encompass the legal
                  company name, physical address, email address, details of an authorized
                  billing contact, and pertinent bank information such as bank name, account
                  number, etc.

                  Users undertake to promptly update this information following any changes.
                  In instances where provided contact information is found to be false or

                <p>4.1 User Content.</p>
                <p>
                  Users recognize that all content, be it information, data, text, images, or
                  other materials ("Content"), is the sole responsibility of the originating
                  party. This signifies that Users, not hire2Inspire, bear complete
                  responsibility for all Content they provide or make available through the
                  Service ("User Content"). Similarly, other Users are accountable for the
                  Content they share ("Other User Content"). Unless specified in Additional
                  Terms, Users may not distribute, sell, rent, lease, license, or otherwise
                  make any Other User Content available to others.

                  and Other User Content, although it retains the right, at its sole
                  discretion, to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any Content. By agreeing to the
                  Terms, Users grant irrevocable consent to such monitoring. If hire2Inspire
                  pre-screens, refuses, or removes any Content, Users acknowledge it's for
                  hire2Inspire's benefit, not theirs. hire2Inspire retains the right to remove
                  any Content, including that which violates the Terms, applicable law, or is
                  objectionable, at its sole discretion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Users are advised to maintain their own copy of all Content provided to the
                  Service since hire2Inspire is not obligated to back up any posted Content.
                </p>
                <p>4.2 Aggregate Data.</p>
                <p>
                  Users grant hire2Inspire the right to utilize User Content for the creation
                  of anonymized, aggregated data, industry reports, and statistics ("Aggregate
                  Data") to serve hire2Inspire's business objectives, industry reporting, and
                  educational purposes. However, such Aggregate Data will not:
                </p>
                <p>(a) Personally identify Users, other Users, or any individuals.</p>
                <p>
                  (b) Enable a third party to determine, wholly or partially, which part of
                  the Aggregate Data relates to specific Users or Entities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In terms of ownership, hire2Inspire will exclusively own all rights, titles,
                  and interests in and to the Aggregate Data among the involved Parties.

                <p>
                  Users are expected to conduct all activities pertaining to these Terms in a
                  professional manner consistent with industry standards. This entails ongoing
                  compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in any jurisdiction

                <p>(b) Compliance with data protection laws.</p>
                <p>
                  Users, their agents, or anyone acting on their behalf must refrain from
                  offering, promising, or providing any form of value, paying bribes, or
                  making improper payments, either directly or indirectly, to public
                  officials. Such actions are strictly prohibited, whether aimed at obtaining
                  new business, retaining existing business, or gaining any improper
                  advantage. Any local practices that contradict these standards are deemed
                  inapplicable and should not be employed.
                </p>

                <p>5.2 Internet Delays.</p>
                <p>
                  The Service might encounter limitations, delays, or other issues inherent in
                  using the internet and electronic communications. hire2Inspire cannot be
                  held responsible for delays, delivery failures, or any damages arising from

                  <strong>6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&nbsp;</strong>
                </p>
                <p>6.1 Types of Damages.</p>
                <p>
                  To the extent legally permitted under applicable law, except for the
                  indemnities outlined in Section 15, neither party will be liable to the
                  other for any special, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. This
                  includes damages or costs due to loss of profits, data, use, or goodwill, or
                  personal or property damage arising from or related to this agreement,
                  regardless of the cause of action or the theory of liability, whether in
                  tort, contract, or otherwise. This limitation applies even if the parties
                  have been informed of the possibility of such damages. Additionally,
                  hire2Inspire will not be liable for procurement costs of substitute products
                  or services.
                </p>
                <p>6.2 Basis of the Bargain.</p>
                <p>
                  The Parties mutually agree that the limitations of liability stated in this
                  section will persist and remain fully effective despite any failure of
                  consideration or exclusive remedy. Both Parties acknowledge that the prices
                  have been established and these Terms agreed upon, relying on these
                  limitations of liability. They recognize that all such limitations
                  constitute an essential foundation of the agreement between the Parties.
                </p>
                <p>6.3 Additional Rights.</p>
                <p>
                  Certain states and/or jurisdictions might not permit the exclusion of
                  implied warranties or limitations of liability for incidental,
                  consequential, or specific other types of damages. Therefore, the exclusions
                  outlined above may not be applicable to Users in those regions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>7. TERMINATION.&nbsp;</strong>
                </p>
                <p>7.1 Term.</p>
                <p>
                  These Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either Users or
                  hire2Inspire as set forth below (the "Term").
                </p>
                <p>7.2 Termination.</p>
                <p>
                  The Parties retain the right to terminate this agreement at any time, with
                  or without cause. If terminated by an Entity, hire2Inspire may consequently
                  terminate any User Accounts for Authorized Users or Recruiters associated
                  with that Entity, in line with Section 7.3 Effect of Termination.
                  Termination must be communicated in writing. Users have the option to
                  terminate the agreement with hire2Inspire by sending an email to&nbsp;

                </p>
                <p>7.3 Effect of Termination.</p>
                <p>Termination of User Accounts entails:</p>
                <p>(a) Revoking access to all features within the Service.</p>
                <p>(b) Deletion of Users' passwords and associated information.</p>
                <p>(c) Prohibition of further use of the Service.</p>
                <p>
                  Upon expiration or termination, Users must promptly cease using the Site and
                  the Service. hire2Inspire reserves the right to terminate any Job due to
                  such termination. Employers will not receive refunds for any payments made
                  to hire2Inspire, including those for hires surviving the Guarantee End as
                  defined in Section 12. Any payment obligations an Employer owes to
                  hire2Inspire related to Jobs and hires, as well as any refund obligations
                  hire2Inspire has to Employers under Section 12, will persist after
                  termination and remain due and payable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a Recruiter's account is terminated, the Recruiter will retain rights to
                  Agency Placement Fees for any Candidates under their Ownership at the
                  termination's time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sections titled IP Ownership, Content and Conduct, Disclaimer, Limitation of
                  Liability, Termination, Miscellaneous, and Indemnification and Hold Harmless
                  in these Terms will endure any termination or expiration. Other terms that,
                  by their nature, reasonably need to survive termination or expiration will
                  also remain in effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>8. MISCELLANEOUS.&nbsp;</strong>
                </p>
                <p>8.1 Governing Law; Venue.</p>
                <p>
                  These Terms, along with any claims, disputes, or controversies arising from
                  them, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York. This choice of
                  law disregards any conflicts of laws principles that might necessitate the
                  application of laws from a different jurisdiction. Any legal action or
                  proceeding stemming from these Terms must be filed in the state or federal
                  courts situated in New York City. Both Users and hire2Inspire irrevocably
                  agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such
                  action or proceeding.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's important to note that the laws in the jurisdiction where Users are
                  located may differ from those in New York. Regardless, the Parties are
                  committed to complying with all applicable international and domestic laws,
                  ordinances, regulations, and statutes concerning their purchase and use of
                  the Service outlined herein.
                </p>
                <p>8.2 Electronic Communication.</p>
                <p>
                  The communications between Users and hire2Inspire are conducted using
                  electronic means, whether Users visit the Site, send emails to hire2Inspire,
                  or receive notices posted on the Service or communicated via email by
                  hire2Inspire. For contractual purposes:
                </p>
                <p>
                  Users consent to receiving communications from hire2Inspire in electronic
                  form.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Users agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures,
                  and other communications provided electronically by hire2Inspire satisfy any
                  legal requirements that such communications would meet if they were in
                  writing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's important to note that this arrangement does not impact Users'
                  statutory rights.
                </p>
                <p>8.3 No Assignment.</p>
                <p>
                  Neither party can assign, subcontract, delegate, or transfer these Terms,
                  including its rights and obligations herein, without obtaining prior written
                  consent from the other party. Any attempted assignment, subcontract,
                  delegation, or transfer in violation of this requirement will be deemed null
                  and void. However, there is an exception: either party can assign these
                  Terms in scenarios involving a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of
                  substantially all assets, or other legal operation without requiring the
                  consent of the other party.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These Terms will remain binding upon the Parties and their respective
                  successors and permitted assigns.
                </p>
                <p>8.4 Miscellaneous.</p>
                <p>
                  These Terms represent the final, complete, and exclusive agreement between
                  the Parties regarding the discussed subject matters. They supersede and
                  consolidate all previous discussions concerning these subjects. Unless
                  expressly specified otherwise in these Terms:
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each party's rights and remedies are cumulative and in addition to any other
                  rights and remedies available at law or in equity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Users agree not to export, re-export, or transfer any technical data
                  acquired from hire2Inspire, or products utilizing such data, in violation of
                  India export laws or regulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All waivers must be in writing. A waiver or failure to enforce any provision
                  of these Terms on one occasion won't be deemed a waiver of any other
                  provision or of that provision on any other occasion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If any provision of these Terms is unenforceable, it will be adjusted to
                  achieve its objectives to the greatest extent possible under applicable law,
                  while the remaining provisions will remain in effect.

                  Users' relationship with hire2Inspire is that of an independent contractor,
                  and neither party acts as the agent or partner of the other. Users won't
                  possess nor represent to any third party that they have authority to act on

                <p>8.5 Information Security.</p>
                <p>
                  hire2Inspire has taken extensive measures to secure the personal information
                  Users provide, aligning with industry standards. Their payment process
                  complies with PCI Service Provider Level 1 standards, ensuring stringent
                  security. Access to Users' data on hire2Inspire's Service is
                  password-protected, and sensitive data like credit card and banking
                  information is shielded by SSL encryption during transmission between Users'
                  web browsers and the Services. Additionally, hire2Inspire offers secure
                  https access to its website.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To safeguard any data stored on hire2Inspire's servers, they regularly
                  monitor their systems for potential vulnerabilities and attacks. They
                  utilize a tier-one secured-access data centre. It's important to note that
                  hire2Inspire neither rents nor sells Users' personal information posted on
                  their Services. They only share Users' information when necessary to perform
                  the described Services.

                  Despite these security measures, the internet isn't entirely full proof.
                  hire2Inspire cannot guarantee the absolute security of transmitted
                  information. There's a risk that information could be accessed, disclosed,
                  altered, or compromised despite hire2Inspire's physical, technical, or
                  managerial safeguards. Users bear the responsibility of safeguarding their
                  login information, as described in Section 1.3.

                <p>
                  Users are required to adhere to all pertinent federal, state, and local
                  laws, encompassing the Equal Employment Opportunity Act, other Equal
                  Employment Opportunity laws, and the Immigration Reform and Control Act
                  (IRCA). Discrimination based on race, colour, religious creed, national
                  origin, age, sex, disability, or veteran status against any Candidate or
                  employee is strictly prohibited. It's acknowledged and mutually agreed upon
                  that hire2Inspire, Users, Entities, and their personnel are in compliance
                  with local governing laws.

                <p>
                  <strong>9. POSTING JOB AND USING THE SERVICE.&nbsp;</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  All job postings must represent actual positions for which the employer is
                  actively seeking immediate hires. The employer commits to reasonably
                  updating the job status on the site, including candidate contact, progress
                  updates, interview scheduling and completion, offer issuance, etc.
                  Additionally, the employer agrees to promptly enter hire details (like start
                  date and First Year Salary) on the site for any successful placements.
                  Direct communication between the employer and candidates submitted, as well
                  as with recruiters, is allowed. The employer may request candidates to apply
                  through their website or Applicant Tracking System (ATS) while ensuring that
                  hire2Inspire retains ownership of the candidate, irrespective of direct
                  communication or application submissions to the ATS after Ownership has been
                  established. Notwithstanding the Terms, employers can use and disclose Other
                  User Content to service providers, agents, and vendors solely for fulfilling
                  a job, including for background checks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>10. EMPLOYER ACCOUNTS.&nbsp;</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The employer can create Authorized User accounts for individuals permitted
                  to use the Service on their behalf. An Administrative User within the
                  employer's organization will oversee the creation and management of these
                  accounts, including setting permissions. Only Authorized Users are allowed
                  access to and use of the Service, and the employer must ensure that each
                  username and password is used exclusively by its designated Authorized User.
                  Safeguarding the confidentiality of login credentials falls under the
                  employer's responsibility, and they are accountable for all activities
                  conducted under these usernames. It's the employer's obligation to ensure
                  that all Authorized Users agree to and adhere to the Terms; any actions or
                  oversights by these Authorized Users are the employer's sole responsibility.
                  Administrative Users within the employer's organization hold the discretion
                  to terminate individual User Accounts acting on behalf of the employer
                  without the explicit permission of the Authorized User. However, any ongoing
                  job processes or outstanding fees will be reassigned to the control of
                  another Authorized User within that employer's organization..

                <p>
                  <strong>11. EMPLOYER FEES.&nbsp;</strong>
                </p>
                <p>11.1 Employer Placement Fee Criteria, Rates, and Ownership.</p>
                <p>
                  The employer is obligated to pay an "Employer Placement Fee" under certain
                  conditions. This fee is applicable if the employer or any of its affiliates
                  hires a Candidate who was submitted to the Employer's Job through the Site
                  or directly to the Employer by any Recruiter, and subsequently, the
                  Candidate is hired via the hire2Inspire Site within one hundred eighty (180)
                  days of their initial entry onto the Site (referred to as the "Ownership
                  Period") for the specific job or any other position within the company.
                </p>
                <p>The Employer Placement Fees consist of:</p>
                <p>
                  (a) A percentage of the Candidate’s First Year Salary, determined by the
                  Recruiter type specified in Section 11.6.
                </p>
                <p>OR</p>
                <p>(b) A fixed, predetermined flat fee set by the employer.</p>
                <p>AND</p>
                <p>(c) Any additional fees that the employer agreed to add as a bonus.</p>
                <p>
                  These fees are applicable based on the terms established and agreed upon
                  between the employer and the recruiting entity, and they become payable
                  under the conditions stated within the outlined timeframe.
                </p>
                <p>11.2 Exceptions to the Employer Placement Fee.</p>
                <p>
                  An Employer Placement Fee will be waived if the Employer can provide
                  documented evidence of prior two-way communication with a Candidate within
                  one hundred eighty (180) days before the posting of the Job. This evidence
                  should include instances where the Candidate responded to the Employer or
                  directly communicated or applied to the Employer. The Employer is required
                  to promptly inform hire2Inspire upon discovering such communication
                  ("Rejection For Ownership").
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's important to note that mere communication from the Employer to the
                  Candidate, without eliciting a response, will not be considered a basis for
                  claiming Rejection For Ownership. Before the Candidate's hiring, notifying
                  Rejection for Ownership involves using the available option on the Site to
                  reject ownership of the Candidate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a Candidate is hired, the claim for Rejection For Ownership is subject
                  to the time and procedural guidelines specified in the Refund Request
                  procedures outlined in Section 12.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, an Employer Placement Fee will not be owed if the Candidate is
                  hired through an independent search conducted by a different hiring manager
                  within the same corporate family, but in a legally separate division or
                  subsidiary that operates without a shared Applicant Tracking System or
                  Candidate Database. This exemption applies when the Candidate was not
                  discovered in connection to any search conducted through hire2Inspire.
                </p>
                <p>11.3 Backdoor Hires.</p>
                <p>
                  Absolutely, if an Employer initiates communication with a Candidate
                  introduced through a Job posting and subsequently hires that Candidate
                  within one hundred eighty (180) days of the Candidate's submission to the
                  Job, hire2Inspire will still be entitled to receive an Employer Placement
                  Fee. This is irrespective of whether the Employer engaged in communication
                  with the Candidate without informing hire2Inspire.
                </p>
                <p>11.4 Circumvention of Workflow.</p>
                <p>
                  Certainly, in the scenario where a Candidate is initially submitted to a Job
                  but contacts the Employer before confirming the submission through the
                  Platform and creating a Completed Submission as per Section 17, hire2Inspire
                  will still be owed an Employer Placement Fee. This holds true provided that
                  hire2Inspire can furnish timestamped evidence proving that the Candidate
                  received notification about the position via the Site before directly
                  contacting the Employer.
                </p>
                <p>11.5 Community, Soliciting, and Referral Agencies.</p>
                <p>
                  This agreement outlines various types of recruiting agencies and their
                  engagement through the hire2Inspire platform:
                </p>
                <ol type={1}>
                  <li>
                    Community Agencies: These agencies undergo vetting by hire2Inspire and
                    join the platform voluntarily, operating under the Recruiter Terms and an
                    Employer Placement Fee specified for each Job on the platform (referred to
                    as the "hire2Inspire Optimized Fee").
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Soliciting Agencies: These agencies, without pre-existing relationships
                    with the Employer but seeking business, are vetted by hire2Inspire. Their
                    acceptance onto the platform is at hire2Inspire's discretion. If accepted,
                    they join voluntarily under the Recruiter Terms and the hire2Inspire
                    Optimized Fee.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Referral Agencies: Agencies with pre-existing relationships with the
                    Employer can join the hire2Inspire service. Each Referral Agency can have
                    a custom placement fee ("Referral Agency Fee"), either a percentage of a
                    Candidate’s First Year Salary or a flat fee determined by the Employer.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Flexible Fee Criteria for Referral Agencies: Referral Agencies may have
                    multiple fee criteria assigned by the Employer. The Employer selects the
                    applicable fee at the time of hire, ensuring correct use based on the
                    criteria input into the hire2Inspire platform.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Adjustment of Referral Agency Fees: Employer discretion allows changes to
                    Referral Agency Fees. These fees are attributed to that specific Referral
                    Agency across all the Employer’s Jobs on the platform.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Transaction Fee Deduction: Referral Agency Fees are subject to a deduction
                    of 6% as a transaction fee from the Employer Placement Fee.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Terms Applicable to Referral Agencies: Referral Agencies abide by
                    provisions applicable to Recruiters, except where specific alternate
                    provisions for Referral Agencies are noted in these Terms, which take
                    precedence over standard provisions for Recruiters.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Superseding Agreements: These Terms take precedence over any existing
                    agreements where the Employer has engaged any Recruiter throughout the
                    duration of the Employer’s term of use with hire2Inspire.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>11.6 Commitment</p>
                <p>
                  This agreement stipulates that the Employer will exert reasonable efforts to
                  ensure hire2Inspire’s exclusivity for third-party agency services covered
                  within this agreement's scope. Existing third-party contingency agency
                  recruiting vendors, engaged in submitting candidates to the Employer, will
                  transition to the hire2Inspire platform as Referral Agencies, as described
                  earlier.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Newly engaged vendors will also be directed to utilize the hire2Inspire
                  platform. All vendors are to be engaged exclusively for candidate
                  submissions through the hire2Inspire platform. However, it's important to
                  note that these Terms do not apply if the Employer hires a retained
                  executive search firm on an exclusive basis for a one-off position.
                </p>
                <p>11.7 Master Collector/Master Payor.</p>
                <p>
                  Under this agreement, the Employer is responsible for remitting all Employer
                  Placement Fees directly to hire2Inspire. hire2Inspire, in turn, assumes the
                  responsibility of disbursing all owed fees to Recruiters associated with any
                  Job and subsequent placements made by the Employer. This includes payments
                  owed to Referral Agencies, specifically related to Candidates submitted
                  after the Employer adopts the hire2Inspire platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Employers are explicitly instructed not to make payments in response to
                  invoices sent directly from any Recruiters. Invoices paid outside the
                  hire2Inspire system will not be considered as fulfilled payments, and as
                  such, will be deemed unpaid according to the terms of this agreement.
                </p>
                <p>11.8 Other Responsibilities.</p>
                <p>
                  That's a crucial responsibility outlined in the agreement. The Employer
                  bears all expenses and efforts related to the recruitment process,
                  background checks, onboarding, and training for any Candidate discovered
                  through a Job posting. This entails the financial costs and resources
                  involved in sourcing, assessing, verifying backgrounds, integrating into the
                  company, and providing necessary training to the hired Candidate.
                </p>
                <p>11.9 Default of Payment.</p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, as per the agreement, if the Employer neglects to make payments for
                  undisputed amounts as outlined in the Terms, hire2Inspire reserves the right
                  to suspend any ongoing Jobs that remain unpaid. This action serves as a
                  measure to ensure compliance with the payment obligations set forth in the
                  agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>12 . GUARANTEE AND REFUNDS.&nbsp;</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Under this provision, if a Candidate hired by the Employer has their
                  employment terminated or if notice of termination/resignation is given or
                  received within the initial ninety (90) days following the start date, the
                  Employer reserves the right to request a full refund of the Employer
                  Placement Fee through a formal process called the "Refund Request."
                </p>
                <p>
                  For this Refund Request to be considered valid, certain conditions must be
                  met:
                </p>
                <ol type={1}>
                  <li>
                    The termination or notice of termination/resignation should occur for any
                    reason except organizational restructuring or redundancy.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The Employer should not have any invoices overdue for more than 30 days at
                    the time of the Refund Request.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The Refund Request must be initiated using the specific workflow provided
                    on the hire2Inspire Site before the expiration of the Guarantee End
                    period.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The Refund Request should include all necessary supporting documents. Any
                    other method of communicating the Refund Request will not be accepted as
                    valid.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  This process ensures that if a Candidate's employment ends within the
                  specified timeframe and circumstances, the Employer has the option to
                  request a refund of the Employer Placement Fee following the defined
                  protocol and within the designated time limits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>13. TAX.&nbsp;</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Absolutely, hire2Inspire commits to making every effort to remain updated on
                  tax laws and ensure compliance with those regulations. However, it's crucial
                  to note that regardless of hire2Inspire's efforts, the Employer is solely
                  responsible for relying on its own tax advice and fulfilling all tax
                  obligations mandated by any relevant taxing authority. This means the
                  Employer is accountable for ensuring the payment of all applicable taxes in
                  accordance with the law, even if hire2Inspire strives to stay current and
                  compliant with tax regulations.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Certainly, hire2Inspire is granted permission to use the Employer's company
                  name, logo, or any other marks exclusively for the purpose of providing the
                  services outlined in the agreement. However, hire2Inspire acknowledges that
                  all rights, titles, and interests in these marks continue to be the sole
                  property of the Employer. This means that while hire2Inspire is authorized
                  to utilize these marks for the agreed-upon services, the ownership and
                  rights associated with these marks remain with the Employer.

                  <strong>15. INDEMNIFICATION AND HOLD HARMLESS.&nbsp;</strong>
                </p>
                <p>15.1 Mutual Indemnification.</p>
                <p>
                  This clause outlines an agreement between hire2Inspire and the Employer to
                  mutually indemnify and protect each other, along with their respective
                  parent companies, affiliates, officers, directors, and employees. The
                  indemnification covers claims, demands, causes of action, liabilities,
                  losses, or damages, including reasonable attorney fees and expenses, arising
                  from negligent acts or omissions or willful misconduct by employees of
                  either party.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The maximum liability for indemnification under this agreement is specified
                  as one crore rupees (INR 1,00,00,000). This means that in the event of any
                  covered claims resulting from the specified actions or behaviours of
                  employees from either party, the indemnification responsibility is limited
                  to this maximum amount.
                </p>
                <p>15.2 Intellectual Property Infringement.</p>
                <p>
                  This provision highlights hire2Inspire's representation and warranty that
                  the use of the Site by the Employer will not infringe upon any rights,
                  specifically including intellectual property rights, belonging to third
                  parties. It asserts that hire2Inspire will indemnify and protect Employers,
                  their affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any
                  claims, demands, losses, or damages, along with reasonable attorneys’ fees
                  and expenses. This indemnification obligation arises from any allegations
                  that, if proven true, would indicate a breach of this particular
                  representation and warranty by hire2Inspire.

                </p>
                <p>
                  These provisions outline certain limitations regarding the solicitation and

                        Throughout the duration of these Terms and for one year after its

                        through media channels or the hiring of individuals who respond to
                        those general solicitations.

                        Recruiters who successfully placed candidates at an Employer are
                        prohibited from actively soliciting for employment or hiring any
                        employees currently employed by that same Employer for one year
                        following their last placement at the Employer.

                      <li>
                        This restriction does not apply if candidates approach the Recruiter
                        independently or in response to general advertising or marketing
                        campaigns initiated by the Recruiter.

                </p>
                <p>
                  This clause specifies the process for Candidate submissions by Recruiters
                  through the Service:
                </p>
                <p>Submission of Candidate Information:</p>
                <p>
                  Recruiters are allowed to provide information about Candidate(s) whose
                  qualifications align with the requirements of the Job through the Service.
                  Each submission of Candidate information is referred to as a "Submission."
                </p>
                <p>Completion of Submission:</p>
                <p>
                  A Submission transforms into a "Completed Submission" when the Candidate
                  independently confirms their interest directly through hire2Inspire. It's
                  emphasized that the Recruiter cannot confirm the Candidate's interest on
                  their behalf.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This process ensures that Candidates actively confirm their interest in the
                  position through hire2Inspire, prohibiting Recruiters from confirming
                  interest on behalf of Candidates, thereby ensuring the authenticity of the
                  Candidate's intent regarding the Job.
                </p>
                <p>17.1 Vetting and Candidate Opt-in.</p>
                <p>
                  This clause delineates the responsibilities and prerequisites for Recruiters
                  before making any Candidate Submission:
                </p>
                <ol type={1}>

                      <li>
                        Prior to making a Submission, the Recruiter must ensure that the
                        Candidate's qualifications align with those specified for the relevant
                        Job.

                      <li>
                        Additionally, the Recruiter must obtain explicit consent from the
                        Candidate for two key aspects:
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Permission for the Recruiter to submit the Candidate's information.

                      <li>
                        Acknowledgment that personal data about the Candidate, whether
                        obtained from the Candidate or the Recruiter, may be retained and
                        utilized by the Employer.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The clause specifies that neither hire2Inspire nor the Recruiter has
                        control over how the Employer uses or stores such data.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>

                    <ul type="disc">
                      <li>
                        The Recruiter holds the responsibility to verify and confirm any
                        references related to the Candidate, which includes validating
                        professional or academic qualifications, certifications, or any work
                        permits necessary to ensure the Candidate's suitability for the Job.

                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  These guidelines emphasize the need for Recruiter-Candidate communication,
                  the Candidate's explicit consent for data usage, and the Recruiter's
                  responsibility for confirming Candidate qualifications and references before
                  making any Submissions for a Job.
                </p>
                <p>17.2 Recruiter’s Content.</p>

                  This clause outlines the ownership and control of content within the context
                  of a Recruiter's Submission:

                      <li>
                        The content within any Submission made by a Recruiter is considered
                        the Recruiter's content for the purposes outlined in the Terms,
                        irrespective of subsequent confirmation by the Candidate.

                        over the content specifically related to them.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The clause emphasizes that a Candidate may possess certain rights
                        pertaining to the content directly concerning them. These rights are
                        held by the Candidate, rather than by the Recruiter or hire2Inspire,
                        regardless of anything stated to the contrary in the Terms.

                        Ownership is awarded separately for each of those respective Jobs.
                        However, the Agency Placement Fee is given to the Recruiter who owns
                        the Candidate for the specific role they were ultimately hired for,
                        regardless of the Job where the hire was marked by the Employer.

                        Ownership and Agency Placement fees will go to the first Recruiter
                        with a Completed Submission on hire2Inspire, provided it falls within
                        the Ownership Period. If the Ownership Period has elapsed, Ownership
                        will transfer to the Recruiter with the next oldest Completed
                        Submission within the Ownership Period.

                  These guidelines outline the intricate scenarios determining Recruiter
                  Ownership of a Candidate and the allocation of Agency Placement Fees based
                  on the specifics of the Candidate's submissions and subsequent hiring.

                <p>17.4 Candidate Rejection.</p>
                <p>
                  Certainly, a Candidate might be rejected for ownership if it's discovered
                  that the Employer had direct communication with that Candidate within the
                  one hundred eighty (180) days before the Submission by the Recruiter. This
                  condition allows for the possibility of rejecting ownership if there's
                  evidence of prior direct communication between the Employer and the
                  Candidate within the specified timeframe prior to the Candidate's submission

                <p>
                  In cases where disputes arise concerning the Ownership of a Candidate,
                  including challenges to the validity of any Rejection For Ownership,
                  hire2Inspire retains the exclusive authority to make the final
                  determination. This provision establishes hire2Inspire as the sole
                  arbitrator in resolving any disputes related to Candidate Ownership,
                  ensuring that hire2Inspire has the ultimate decision-making power in such
                  matters.

                  for each Job, considering various factors like the Candidate's First Year
                  Salary, flat fees, and additional bonuses set by the Employer. However, the
                  final payment to the Recruiter may be subject to deductions as specified in
                  different sections or due to any fees incurred by hire2Inspire in the
                  payment process.

                  This clause stipulates that all Agency Placement Fees will be subject to a
                  processing fee of 0.5% of the Employer Placement Fee. This means that when
                  the Agency Placement Fee is paid to the Recruiter, a deduction of 0.5% of
                  that fee will be made as a platform charge before disbursing the payment to
                  the Recruiter.

                </ol>
                <p>
                  This provision ensures that these Terms hold greater authority and relevance

                <p>20.2 Independent Contractors.</p>
                <p>
                  This section establishes the nature of the relationship between hire2Inspire
                  and the Recruiter:
                </p>
                <ol type={1}>
                  <li>
                    Independent Contractor Relationship:
                    <ul type="disc">
                      <li>
                        The agreement intends to establish the status of the Recruiter as an
                        independent contractor and not an employee, partner, or participant in
                        a joint venture or partnership with hire2Inspire.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Tax and Legal Representation:

                        The Recruiter agrees not to take any position in tax returns, benefit
                        applications, or legal proceedings involving hire2Inspire that
                        contradicts the status of the Recruiter as an independent contractor.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    No Agency or Authorization:
                    <ul type="disc">
                      <li>
                        The Recruiter is not an agent of hire2Inspire and is not authorized to
                        act on behalf of hire2Inspire or make commitments on its behalf.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The Recruiter is prohibited from representing to any third party that
                        they have the authority to act on behalf of hire2Inspire.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  This clause is designed to explicitly define the independent contractor
                  relationship between hire2Inspire and the Recruiter, outlining the
                  limitations and responsibilities regarding tax, legal representation, and
                  agency authority.
                </p>
                <p>20.3 No Benefits.</p>
                <p>
                  The excerpt you provided seems to outline the specific terms and conditions
                  between hire2Inspire and the Recruiter, establishing that the Recruiter is
                  considered an independent contractor rather than an employee. As such,
                  certain benefits and entitlements typically extended to employees, such as
                  group insurance, profit-sharing, retirement benefits, social security or
                  payroll tax withholdings, unemployment insurance, disability insurance, and
                  workers' compensation, will not be provided to the Recruiter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This arrangement is common for independent contractors, as they operate
                  separately from the company's formal employee structure. Independent
                  contractors are usually responsible for their own benefits, taxes, and
                  insurance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's crucial for both hire2Inspire and the Recruiter to fully understand and
                  adhere to these terms, as misclassification or misunderstandings regarding
                  employment status and benefits can lead to legal and financial complications
                  for both parties.

                </p>
                <p>21.1 Job Confidentiality.</p>
                <p>
                  This section emphasizes the importance of maintaining confidentiality
                  regarding job details, including specific employer information and
                  job-related specifics like salary. The recruiter is bound to keep this
                  information confidential and cannot publicly disclose it. However, they are
                  allowed to share these details with potential candidates in a private and
                  direct manner to facilitate the recruitment process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moreover, it specifies limitations on using the employer's branding, such as
                  logos or company names, in any public or private communication aimed at
                  attracting candidates. This aims to prevent the recruiter from using the
                  employer's identity to solicit candidates without authorization.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, it's outlined that any personal or confidential information
                  about new hires must be kept confidential and not shared with third parties,
                  including competitors of the employer or hire2Inspire. The recruiter is only
                  permitted to use such information in an aggregated and de-identified manner
                  for internal business purposes, and only in compliance with relevant laws
                  governing data privacy and retention.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This section highlights the significance of discretion and the responsible
                  handling of sensitive information throughout the recruitment process to
                  safeguard the interests of both the employer and the candidates involved.
                </p>

                  </li>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Exceptions to Solicitation Clauses: Certain solicitation clauses do not
                    apply if candidates approach the recruiter on their own volition or in

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Candidate Sourcing: The recruiter cannot identify an employer's name
                    without first establishing the potential candidate's interest in the job

                    candidates.
                  </li>

                    another search firm might be entitled to compensation upon the candidate's

                <p>
                  This section seems to specify that candidates are not permitted to create
                  accounts directly on the service. However, if candidates provide personal
                  information or any content through another means or channel related to the
                  service, this information becomes part of "Your Content" and is subject to
                  the service's terms and conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The platform reserves the right to adjust, reformat, or remove certain
                  elements of the content provided by candidates to ensure its compatibility
                  or utilization within the service.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's important for candidates to be aware that even if they don't have
                  direct accounts on the service, any personal information they voluntarily
                  share or confirm in relation to the service is considered "Your Content" and
                  falls under the terms and conditions governing the service.

                  <strong>24. ACCESS TO AND TRANSFER OF CANDIDATE INFORMATION&nbsp;</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This section outlines the candidate's acknowledgment and consent regarding
                  the accessibility and potential transfer of their information during the
                  hiring process. Here are the key points:
                </p>
                <ol type={1}>
                  <li>
                    Access by Involved Parties: The candidate acknowledges that various
                    individuals involved in the hiring process, such as the submitting
                    recruiter, representatives from the recruiter's agency, employer
                    representatives associated with the specific job opening, and members of
                    the hire2Inspire team, may access the information provided by the
                    candidate and their representing recruiter.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    International Access: These individuals may access candidate information
                    from locations outside the candidate's country or region. This implies
                    that the candidate's information might be viewed or managed from different
                    geographic locations.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Consent for Access and Transfer: The candidate explicitly grants consent
                    for these individuals to access and potentially transfer the candidate's
                    information in the context of the hiring process. This consent extends to
                    the various stages of the hiring process and the involved parties'
                    legitimate need to access and handle candidate details.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Transfer to Other Software Platforms: Candidate information might be
                    automatically or manually transferred to other software platforms integral
                    to the hiring process. These platforms could include CRMs (Customer
                    Relationship Management systems), Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), video
                    interviewing platforms, or interview scheduling tools.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Full Consent for Information Transfer: The candidate grants full consent
                    for their information to be transferred to these related software
                    platforms as part of the hiring process.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  This section serves to inform candidates about the potential access,
                  handling, and transfer of their information during the hiring process,
                  seeking their explicit consent for such actions. It emphasizes the
                  involvement of multiple stakeholders and the possibility of information
                  being accessed and managed across different platforms and geographic
                  locations.

                  <strong>25. RIGHT TO REPRESENT&nbsp;</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This section outlines the process by which candidates are submitted for job
                  opportunities through the hire2Inspire platform and the implications of
                  candidate confirmation and completion of the submission:
                </p>
                <ol type={1}>
                  <li>
                    Submission Process: Candidates are submitted for a job opportunity by a
                    recruiter using the hire2Inspire platform. Candidates are required to
                    confirm their interest in the job by using a link provided by the
                    hire2Inspire system. Only when this confirmation step is completed does
                    the submission process become finalized.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Candidate Information Sharing: Candidate information is shared with the
                    employer only after the candidate has confirmed their interest and
                    completed the submission process through the hire2Inspire system.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Rights to Agency Placement Fees: Upon completing the submission process,
                    the candidate confirms that the submitting recruiter holds the rights to
                    agency placement fees associated with the successful placement of that
                    candidate as per Section 17.3 of the agreement.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Binding Nature of Right to Represent: The "Right to Represent" granted to
                    the submitting recruiter is binding. This means that once the candidate
                    completes the submission and confirms the recruiter's rights, the
                    candidate cannot revoke the recruiter's right to represent them for that
                    specific job opportunity. Additionally, the candidate cannot assign this
                    right to another recruiter.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  This section emphasizes the importance of candidate confirmation in the
                  submission process and establishes the binding nature of the recruiter's
                  right to represent the candidate for the specified job opportunity upon
                  completion of the submission process.
